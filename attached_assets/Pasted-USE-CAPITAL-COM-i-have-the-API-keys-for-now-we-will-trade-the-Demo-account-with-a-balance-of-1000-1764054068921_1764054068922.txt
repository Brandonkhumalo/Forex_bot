USE CAPITAL.COM, i have the API keys for now we will trade the Demo  account with a balance of $1000

create for me a ML based trading AI engine, for the first 30 trades the AI engine should trade using technical analysis, after the 30 trades the AI will then use ML to predict profitable trades based on the closed 30 trades, it should combine ML and technical analysis strategies. once the 30 trades mark has been hit then for every 10 closed trades the ML should retrain itself. The AI should run 24/7 and be able to predict USD and GBP news events. The AI should trade these pairs only: XAU/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, NZD/USD. Every 60secs the AI should run a trading cycle to find another trade as long the balance agrees

the user should have the button option in the dashboard of stopping and starting AI. there should also be a analysis page where the user can see the win rate and other analytical tools to see how the AI and ML are performing meaning the backend should have a db to save trade data. each forex pair should have a limit of 20% of the capital (if i have $100 and the ai trades GBP/USD then $20 is dedicated to GBP/USD), XAU/USD should have a limit of 15% of the capital. The AI and ML should calculate and put the TP and SL at 10% of the account balance.

all the trade data will be coming from the live API and the system should use a cache system of 60secs for non essential requests to ease the API requests. The system should allow the user to sign up and log in

Technical Analysis Strategies:
4. Price Action Strategies (No indicators)
a) Supply & Demand Zones
Identify institutional zones
Buy in demand, sell in supply

Buy at bullish FVG / sell at bearish FVG
d) Order Blocks
